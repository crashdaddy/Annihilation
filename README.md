# Annihilation
HTML5 video game shooter

This is a CANVAS-based space shooter game using Phaser 3

It is in bad need of refactoring. Several code elements are repeated throughout when they could be made into function calls.

The explosion sprites when the player dies don't fully disappear after their animation completes.

Attract mode could use some work.

Needs levels, bosses, power-ups, bigger guns
