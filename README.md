# Annihilation
HTML5 video game shooter

This is a CANVAS-based space shooter game using Phaser 3. The controls are taken from Robotron 2084, where you use the WASD keys to move your ship around and the mouse to turn the ship and fire. It's pretty fun.

It is in bad need of refactoring. Several code elements are repeated throughout when they could be made into function calls.

The explosion sprites when the player dies don't fully disappear after their animation completes.

Attract mode could use some work.

Needs levels, bosses, power-ups, bigger guns
